# vsd-workshop-gul
Digital VLSI SoC design and planning

The workshop started with an introduction to Openlane
Openlane is a flow that automates the entire process from RTL to GDS.

The first task was to calculate the flip-flop ratio which is defined as
$$ \frac{total number of d flip flops}{total number of cells used in design} $$

total number of d flip flops/total number of cells used in design
Here in my design
flip flop ratio = 1613/14876 * 100 = 10.84%
